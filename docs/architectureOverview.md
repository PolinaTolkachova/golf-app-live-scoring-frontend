## 1. Client-Side (Frontend) Application

### Purpose
- Provide a user interface to display results, input scores, manage player profiles, etc.

### Technologies
- **React.js**: Used for building a responsive and dynamic user interface.

## 2. Server-Side (Backend) Application

### Purpose
- Handle business logic.
- Process requests and interact with the database.
- Interact with Frontend application.

### Technologies
- **Spring Boot**: A Java framework for building production-ready services.
- **RESTful APIs (Spring MVC)**: Handle HTTP requests from the frontend or external services.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: Ensure authentication and secure communication.

## 3. Database

### Purpose
- Serve as persistent storage for player information, scores, tournament details, etc.

### Technologies
- **PostgreSQL**: A relational database designed for structured data.

## 4. Data Layer (ORM)

### Purpose
- Facilitate interaction with the database in an object-oriented manner.

### Technologies
- **Hibernate**: An ORM tool for mapping Java objects to database tables.

## 5. DevOps and Deployment

### Purpose
- Automate deployment, scaling, and management of application infrastructure.

### Technologies
- **AWS**: Utilize cloud hosting and related services for infrastructure management.

## Key Considerations

### Scalability
- Ensure the application can scale with the number of users and players.
- Use cloud services and container orchestration to efficiently manage resources.

### User Experience
- Optimize the application for both mobile and web platforms.
- Aim for fast load times and intuitive interfaces to enhance user engagement.
